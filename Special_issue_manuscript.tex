%			To determining reliable methodologies and models for the estimation of viscosities, equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations for normal and branched alkanes ranging from two to sixteen carbons were performed with the GROMACS package. Viscosities along the liquid/vapor saturation curve and at 293 K and high-pressure conditions were generated using the TraPPE, Potoff, and TAMie force fields. Viscosities were calculated from simulations using the Green-Kubo method. Reliable data and uncertainties were determined by performing many replicate simulations and analyzing the data distributions. Potoff and TAMie, modern force fields making use of the Mie $\lambda$-6 (the generalized Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential), outperform the older TraPPE force field which makes use of the traditional Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. Simulations carried out with the Potoff or TAMie potentials more closely follow trends in viscosity. The TraPPE force field consistently under predicts viscosities. Although simulations with the Potoff force field over estimate viscosity with respect to density, a fortuitous cancellation of errors results in good prediction of viscosity with respect to pressure. The performance of the TAMie force field is usually better than TraPPE but slightly worse than Potoff. All force fields perform somewhat better for normal alkanes than for branched alkanes and the differences in performance between force fields is more noticeable in the case of normal alkanes.

%			While many common force fields are developed based only liquid density and heat of vaporization at 25 C, several more recent force fields have taken into account vapor pressure and liquid density over substantial portions of the coexistence curve for multiple compounds simultaneously, enhancing transferability. This manuscript explores the hypothesis that greater accuracy in characterizing the coexistence properties may lead to greater accuracy for viscosity predictions. Three united atom force fields are considered in detail: the TraPPE-UA model of Siepmann and coworkers, the TAMie model of Gross and coworkers, the AUA4 model of Ungerer and coworkers, and the TraMie model of Potoff and coworkers. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are performed in the NVT ensemble using the Green-Kubo method for viscosity characterization. Simulations are performed for linear alkanes with three to twelve carbons and branched alkanes with four to nine carbons.  Simulation conditions follow the saturated liquid from reduced temperatures of 0.5-0.9 and along key isotherms in the dense liquid region. In general, the more accurate force fields for coexistence properties do indeed predict viscosity more accurately. For saturated liquids, both the TraMie and TAMie models provide roughly 10~\% accuracy for linear alkanes, while deviations are closer to 20-30~\% for AUA4 and TraPPE-UA models. For branched alkanes the behavior is more complicated but TraMie still provides roughly 15~\% accuracy while TraPPE-UA adn AUA4 accuracy is around 25-35~\% deviations. TAMie force fields for branched alkanes were unavailable at thee time of this study.For compressed liquids,  the Mie potential models perform better once again, but tend to over estimate the viscosity at very high pressures. Coincidentally, these models also tend to over estimate the pressure, such that plots of viscosity vs. pressure are  accurate to within about 10~\% up to 200 MPa. Experimental viscosity data tend to be sparse above 200 MPa, but accurate predictions are obtained for propane to 1000 MPa. Uncertainty estimates increase substantially for high pressures at low reduced temperatures. Nevertheless, a prediction is made for the viscosity of 2,2,4, trimethylhexane at 293K and 1000 MPa, in compliance with the guidelines of the 10th IFPSC.

%			While many common force fields are developed based on liquid density and heat of vaporization at room temperature, several more recent force fields have taken into account saturated vapor pressure and saturated liquid density over substantial portions of the vapor-liquid coexistence curve for multiple compounds simultaneously, enhancing transferability. 

			Over the past decade, the Mie $\lambda$-6 (generalized Lennard-Jones) potential has grown in popularity due to its improved accuracy for predicting vapor-liquid coexistence densities and pressure compared to the traditional Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. This manuscript explores the hypothesis that greater accuracy in characterizing the coexistence properties may lead to greater accuracy for viscosity predictions. Four united-atom force fields are considered in detail: the Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE-UA and the recently developed TraPPE-2) model of Siepmann and coworkers, the Transferable Anisotropic Mie (TAMie) model of Gross and coworkers, the fourth generation anisotropic-united-atom (AUA4) model of Ungerer and coworkers, and the model of Potoff and coworkers. 
			
			Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are analyzed using the Green-Kubo method for viscosity characterization. Simulations are performed for linear alkanes with two to twenty-two carbons and branched alkanes with four to eight carbons. Simulation conditions follow the saturated liquid from reduced temperatures of 0.5 to 0.85 and along the 293 K isotherm in the dense liquid region. 
			
			In general, the more accurate force fields for coexistence properties do indeed predict viscosity more accurately. For saturated liquids, both Mie-based potential models (Potoff and TAMie) provide roughly 10~\% accuracy for linear alkanes, while deviations are between 20 and 50~\% for TraPPE-UA. For branched alkanes, the performance is slightly diminished, but Potoff still provides roughly 15 to 20~\% accuracy, while the TAMie force field results in deviations of 20 to 40~\%, and TraPPE-UA has deviations of approximately 25 to 60~\%. The AUA4 deviations are 10 to 20~\% for ethane and 30 to 60~\% for 2,2-dimethylpropane, the only compounds tested with the AUA4 force field. The TraPPE-2 deviations for ethane are similar to those using the original TraPPE force field, namely, between 10 and 20~\%. The percent deviations for each compound and force field tend to increase with decreasing temperature, with the exception of the Potoff deviations for propane, which are nearly constant to the triple point temperature. 
			
			For compressed liquids, the Mie-based potential models perform better once again than the Lennard-Jones-based force fields, but tend to over estimate the viscosity at very high densities. As the Potoff and TAMie models also tend to over estimate the pressure at high densities, a fortuitous cancellation of errors leads to predictions of viscosity with respect to pressure that are accurate to within about 10~\%. The comparison with experimental viscosity data is limited to pressures below 200 MPa for most normal and branched alkanes. However, accurate predictions are obtained for propane near 1000 MPa with the Potoff force field.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	The design of efficient and reliable technical processes requires accurate estimates of thermophysical properties. Shear viscosity $(\eta)$ is an important property for characterizing flow, e.g., sizing pumps, assessing flow assurance in fossil fuel recovery, and lubricating bearings in tribological applications. There are primarily three different means by which shear viscosity values are obtained: experimental measurement, semi-empirical prediction models, and molecular simulation (molecular dynamics, MD). Significant limitations exist for each of these methods. 
	
	For example, experimental measurements can be expensive, time-consuming, and challenging at extreme temperatures $(T)$ and pressures $(P)$. Experimental data tend to be distributed among several prototypes of linear, branched, ring, and polar molecules, with many gaps among a homologous series. Most experimental data are available below 200 MPa, while tribological applications may require estimates at pressures as high as 1000 MPa. Flow assurance applications are generally at pressures below 200 MPa, but at temperatures of 423 to 523 K. The ever expanding conditions of interest and economic constraints on new measurements foster increased research in predictive methods.

%    Although most compounds lack \textit{reliable} experimental data covering a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and densities $(\rho)$,
    
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference Fluid Properties (REFPROP) database software provides ``reference quality'' viscosity correlations for experimentally well-studied compounds (around 100 species) \cite{LEMMON-RP91}. Most compounds, however, do not have sufficient \textit{reliable} experimental data covering a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and densities $(\rho)$ for developing ``reference quality'' correlations. These less-studied compounds require predictive methods that pool together data from several related molecular species. 
    
    Semi-empirical prediction models are typically not reliable over the industrially relevant ranges of $P \rho T$ \cite{PGL}. For example, corresponding states methods are recommended for vapors, dense fluids, and high temperature liquids. These methods rely on the similarity of trends in the properties relative to reference compounds, e.g., methane and \textit{n}-octane. Corresponding states methods are less reliable for more complex molecular structures, e.g., branched compounds. Typical compilations indicate that deviations from experiment may vary by 5 to 50~\%, with little guidance about when to expect lower or higher accuracy. 
    
    For low temperature liquids, group contribution schemes are favored, but these tend to extrapolate poorly when applied to compounds or conditions outside the training set. More recent advances such as machine learning \cite{Mulero2017,Lee2017} and entropy scaling \cite{Lotgering2015} have shown great promise in prediction of historically challenging properties, such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension. However, machine learning relies on large amounts of experimental data and often suffers from dubious extrapolation. While entropy scaling has a stronger theoretical basis, it requires a reliable reference viscosity and an adequate equation-of-state, which may not be readily available for the compound of interest.
	
	%due to its weak theoretical basis.
	
	%  tend to look like a mixed bag, with some methods recommended at high temperatures and others at low temperatures, and still more correlations recommended for pressure effects.
	%   If an effect like branching, for example, alters the trend, the these methods tend to break down.
	
	%Among the recommended semi-empirical methods, many require a known viscosity, like the saturated liquid viscosity, in order to predict the viscosity at unsaturated conditions. For purposes of the current investigation, we have set a goal of predicting the viscosity of 2,2,4 trimethylhexane at 1000 MPa. Therefore, neither the saturation viscosity nor the variation with pressure are known. Furthermore, the degree of branching suggests that corresponding states methods may be unreliable.
	
%	Semi-empirical models often struggle from poor extrapolation due to model deficiencies, over-fitting, and the scarcity of \textit{reliable} experimental data over a wide range of $P \rho T$ state space.
	
%	Molecular dynamics requires extremely reliable force fields and robust simulation methods.
	
%	Unfortunately, the range of available (and reliable) experimental viscosity data does not cover the entire range of $P \rho T$ of interest. 
	
	As an alternative to experiment and semi-empirical prediction models, molecular simulation is an attractive means for estimating viscosity. However, there are two fundamental challenges impeding the use of molecular simulation as a mainstream chemical engineering tool for viscosity prediction. The first challenge is that obtaining reproducible results is more difficult for transport properties, such as viscosity, than for thermodynamic properties. Recently, a ``Best Practices Guide'' was developed to address this challenge, namely, to improve reproducibility of viscosity estimates \cite{Maginn2018}. We apply these ``Best Practices'' and address some outstanding issues mentioned therein.
	
	The second challenging aspect of obtaining accurate simulation estimates is that viscosity is extremely sensitive to the force field. In addition to the strong dependence on the non-bonded interactions, the bonded potential plays a much greater role for viscosity than for thermodynamic properties. For example, varying the torsional potential has a significant impact on viscosity \cite{Nieto2006}, while vapor-liquid coexistence is relatively unaffected \cite{Bernard2009}. Therefore, the ability to predict viscosities with molecular simulation requires both robust methods and adequate force fields.

	%RAM1: I don't feel like this fits in the molecular simulation discussion unless we mention how the force field must also predict saturation densities and PVT behavior.
	
%    Viscosity estimates can be obtained from both equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. Recently, a ``Best Practices Guide'' for EMD was developed to improve reproducibility. 

	 %However, the focus of this study is the second challenge, namely, determining the most accurate force field(s). 
	 
%	 We investigate the accuracy of united-atom (UA) Mie $\lambda$-6 force fields, a popular class designed for the engineering purpose of predicting thermophysical properties. Specifically, the force fields we compare are the Transferable Potential for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE-UA and TraPPE-UA2), Transferable Anisotropic Mie (TAMie), Potoff, and fourth generation anisotropic-united-atom (AUA4). The suitability of these force fields for quantitative viscosity prediction has been widely debated in the literature.

	 We investigate the accuracy of four force fields, namely, Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE-UA, also referred to simply as TraPPE \cite{TraPPE,Martin1999,TraPPEUA2}), Transferable Anisotropic Mie (TAMie) \cite{TAMie,Weidler2016}, Potoff \cite{Mie,Potoff_branched}, and fourth generation anisotropic-united-atom (AUA4) \cite{AUA4,Nieto2008}. Each force field is a variation of the united-atom (UA) Mie $\lambda$-6 (generalized Lennard-Jones, LJ) model, a popular class designed for the engineering purpose of predicting thermophysical properties. However, the suitability of these force fields for quantitative viscosity prediction, especially at high pressures, has been widely debated in the literature.
	 
%	 Recently, it was shown that the Mie 14-6 and 16-6 potentials of TAMie and Potoff, respectively, are overly repulsive at high densities/pressures.
	
%	Recently, a ``Best Practices Guide'' was developed to address the first challenge, namely, to improve reproducibility \cite{Maginn2018}.

The suitability of these force fields for quantitative viscosity prediction has been widely debated in the literature. 
	
%	By contrast, Reference \citenum{Gordon2006} suggests that great improvement is obtained by utilizing a Mie $\lambda$-6 potential over the traditional Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. Recently, it was shown that Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials are overly repulsive at high densities/pressures. For these reasons, we study how well the united-atom Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials perform both at saturation and elevated pressures.
	
%	However, this study focused on viscosities of saturated liquids.
	
	%Some studies have suggested that united-atom models are not capable of accurately reproducing viscosity and, therefore, anisotropic-united-atom or all-atom models are needed \cite{Allen1997,Payal2012,Mondello1997}.
	
	For example, depending on the compound structure and state conditions, some studies suggest that UA LJ 12-6 models (e.g., TraPPE) are inadequate for estimating viscosities and recommend the use of anisotropic-united-atom (AUA) or all-atom (AA) models for this purpose \cite{Allen1997,Payal2012,Mondello1997,Ungerer2007}. Considering the significant increase in computational cost of AA simulations, two promising alternatives have been investigated, namely, the Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials and/or modified torsional models. For example, Nieto-Draghi et al. demonstrate significant improvement in viscosity prediction for the AUA4 model by increasing the torsional barriers \cite{Nieto2006}. In addition, the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 model has been shown to accurately predict saturated liquid viscosity $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$ without significant degradation of other vapor-liquid saturation properties \cite{Gordon2006}, i.e., saturated liquid density $(\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$, saturated vapor density $(\rho_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat})$, and saturated vapor pressure $(P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat})$.   
	
%For example, some studies suggest that, depending on the compound structure and state conditions, united-atom models are inadequate for estimating viscosities and recommend the use of anisotropic-united-atom (AUA) or all-atom (AA) models for this purpose \cite{Allen1997,Payal2012,Mondello1997,Ungerer2007}. However, these studies focused primarily on UA Lennard-Jones (LJ) 12-6 force fields. Reference \citenum{Gordon2006} provides evidence that the UA Mie $\lambda$-6 potential can accurately predict saturated liquid viscosity $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$ without significant deprecation of other vapor-liquid saturation properties, i.e., saturated liquid density $(\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$, saturated vapor density $(\rho_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat})$, and saturated vapor pressure $(P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat})$. Alternatively, Reference \citenum{Nieto2006} demonstrated significant improvement in viscosity prediction by modifying the AUA4 torsional potential (AUA4m). Considering the significant increase in computational cost of AA simulations, Mie $\lambda$-6 and/or modified torsional potentials are a desirable alternative to AA force fields.

%	 it is argued that united-atom or anisotropic-united-atom (AUA) models may be inadequate for predicting viscosity \cite{Ungerer2007}. 
	
%	Reference \citenum{Hoang2017} demonstrates that including viscosity data in the force field development can improve the identification of a unique set of transferable Mie $\lambda$-6 parameters, while improving viscosity predictions simultaneously.

%    The force fields compared in this study were optimized solely with static vapor-liquid coexistence data, e.g., saturated liquid densities and saturated vapor pressures. Therefore, an additional purpose of this study is to determine the transferability of these force fields that were not parameterized without viscosity data.

While the Potoff and TAMie force fields have shown considerable promise in predicting static properties (primarily $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$), their ability to predict dynamic properties has not been investigated previously. Reference \citenum{Hoang2017} demonstrates that including viscosity data in the force field development can improve the identification of a unique set of transferable Mie $\lambda$-6 parameters, while improving viscosity predictions simultaneously.

	\subsection{Force fields} \label{Force Field}
	
	A united-atom (UA) or anisotropic-united-atom (AUA) representation is used for each compound studied, i.e., normal and branched alkanes are represented with CH$_3$, CH$_2$, CH, and C sites. UA models assume that the UA interaction site is that of the carbon atom, while AUA models assume that the AUA interaction site is shifted away from the carbon atom and towards the hydrogen atom(s). Note that TraPPE and Potoff are UA force fields while TraPPE-2 (a recent improvement of TraPPE for ethane and ethylene), AUA4, and TAMie are AUA force fields. 
	
%	The UA and AUA groups required for normal and branched alkanes are sp$^3$ hybridized CH$_3$, CH$_2$, CH, and C sites. For most literature models, a single (transferable) parameter set is assigned for each interaction site. However, two exceptions exist for the force fields studied. First, TAMie implements a different set of CH$_3$ parameters for ethane. Second, Potoff reports a ``generalized'' and ``short/long'' (S/L) CH and C parameter set. The Potoff ``generalized'' CH and C parameter set is an attempt at a completely transferable set. However, since the ``generalized'' parameters performed poorly for some compounds, the S/L parameter set was proposed, where the ``short'' and ``long'' parameters are implemented when the number of carbons in the backbone is $\le 4$ and $> 4$, respectively. 
	
%	Note that only the terminal CH$_3$ sites are shifted in the TAMie force field. By contrast, AUA4 displaces the interaction location of non-terminal CH$_2$ and CH sites as well. For simplicity, we only utilize the AUA4 force field with compounds that are composed exclusively of CH$_3$ and C interaction sites, i.e., ethane and 2,2-dimethylpropane. Table \ref{tab:bond-lengths} provides the effective bond-lengths for terminal CH$_3$ sites. The bond-length for all non-terminal sites is 0.154 nm.

%    A fixed bond-length is used for each bond between UA or AUA sites. Note that, although static thermodynamic properties are generally insensitive to the choice of fixed or flexible bonds, dynamic properties, such as viscosity, are much more sensitive. For this reason, we test the degree of variability that arises by implementing a harmonic oscillator model. The results are provided as Supporting Information.

	Non-bonded interactions between sites located in two different molecules or separated by more than three bonds within the same molecule are calculated using a Mie $\lambda$-6 potential (of which the Lennard-Jones, LJ, 12-6 is a subclass) \cite{Herdes2015}:
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:Mie}
	u^{\rm vdw}(\epsilon,\sigma,\lambda;r) = \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - 6}\right)\left(\frac{\lambda}{6}\right)^{\frac{6}{\lambda - 6}} \epsilon \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{\lambda} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]
	\end{equation} 
	where $u^{\rm vdw}$ is the van der Waals interaction, $\sigma$ is the distance $(r)$ where $u^{\rm vdw} = 0$, $-\epsilon$ is the energy of the potential at the minimum $\left(\text{i.e., }u^{\rm vdw} = -\epsilon \text{ and } \frac{\partial u^{\rm vdw}}{\partial r} = 0 \text{ for } r=r_{\rm min} \right)$, and $\lambda$ is the repulsive exponent.

    Note that TAMie implements an ethane-specific set of CH$_3$ parameters. TraPPE and TraPPE-2 are both considered in this study for ethane. Also, Potoff reports a ``generalized'' and ``short/long'' (S/L) CH and C parameter set. The ``short'' and ``long'' parameters are implemented when the number of carbons in the backbone is $\le 4$ and $> 4$, respectively. Due to their superior accuracy, we only provide results for the Potoff S/L parameter set.
    
    %The Potoff ``generalized'' CH and C parameter set is an attempt at a completely transferable set.

	Non-bonded parameters between two different site types (i.e., cross-interactions) are determined using Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules \cite{Allen1987} for $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ and an arithmetic mean for the repulsive exponent $\lambda$ (as recommended in Reference \citenum{Mie}):
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lorentz-Berthelot_eps}
	\epsilon_{ij} = \sqrt{\epsilon_{ii} \epsilon_{jj}}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lorentz-Berthelot_sig}
	\sigma_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ii} + \sigma_{jj}}{2}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:Lorentz-Berthelot_lam}
	\lambda_{ij} = \frac{\lambda_{ii} + \lambda_{jj}}{2}
	\end{equation}
	where the $ij$ subscript refers to cross-interactions and the subscripts $ii$ and $jj$ refer to same-site interactions.

	Viscosity estimates can be obtained from both equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The ``Best Practices Guide'' is currently limited to EMD methods and purports that NEMD might be necessary for high viscosities (greater than 0.02 Pa-s). One purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that, by applying these guidelines, EMD can also provide meaningful estimates for highly viscous systems. 
	
%	 that EMD is capable of providing reproducible estimates of viscosity   recommended for estimating viscosity with the Green-Kubo analysis of EMD. 
	
%	Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are performed using GROMACS version 2018 \cite{GROMACS_2018}. Each simulation uses the Velocity Verlet integrator with a 2 fs time-step, Nos{\'e}-Hoover thermostat with a time constant of 1 ps, a cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions with tail corrections for energy and pressure \cite{GROMACS_note}, and fixed bond-lengths constrained using LINCS with a LINCS-order of eight. We implement the non-bonded cut-off distance recommended for each force field, namely, TraPPE, TAMie, and AUA4 utilize a 1.4 nm cut-off while a cut-off of 1.0 nm is employed for Potoff (with the exception of \textit{n}-hexadecane which was unstable with this short cut-off distance). Coulombic interactions are not computed as none of the force fields require partial charges for the compounds studied.

%	The equilibration time is 1 ns, while the production time depends on the system, i.e., the compound and state point, where larger compounds, lower temperatures, and higher densities necessitate longer simulations. For most systems, 1 ns is a sufficient production time, while an 8 ns production time is required for the most viscous systems, e.g., 2,2,4-trimethylpentane at elevated pressures. As recommended by BLANK, we investigate several different production times (1, 2, 4, and 8 ns) for some select systems to verify that our simulations are sufficiently long.
	
	Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are performed using GROMACS version 2018 with ``mixed'' (single and double) precision \cite{GROMACS_2018}. GROMACS is compiled using GNU 7.3.0, OpenMPI enabled, and GPU support disabled. Approximately three-fourths of the simulations are run using Linux 4.4.0-112-generic x86\_64 on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20GHz machine while the remaining one-fourth are run using Linux 4.15.0-22-generic x86\_64 on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2450 0 @ 2.10GHz machine. Example GROMACS input files (.top, .gro. and .mdp) with corresponding shell and python scripts for preparing, running, and analyzing simulations are provided as Supporting Information. 
	
	%In addition, the shell and python scripts used for preparing and analyzing simulations are available on GitHub \cite{BLANK}. 
	
	Simulation specifications are provided in Table \ref{tab:sim_specs}. Note that each force field utilizes a 1.4 nm non-bonded cut-off distance, with the exception of Potoff which employs a 1.0 nm cut-off (as recommended in Reference \citenum{Mie}) except for certain compounds (see Section \ref{Cut-off distance}). Analytical tail corrections are applied in all cases \cite{GROMACS_note}. For most systems, 1 ns is a sufficient production time, while longer simulations are required for the more viscous systems, e.g., 16 ns for 2,2,4-trimethylpentane at 1000 MPa. Sections \ref{Finite-size effects} and \ref{Cut-off distance} provide a detailed analysis for the number of molecules and the cut-off lengths, respectively. Sections \ref{SI:Simulation time} and \ref{fixed flexible} of Supporting Information investigate, respectively, the sensitivity of our results to the production time and constrained bonds. To validate our methods, a comparison with other reference simulation values \cite{NIST_SRSW,Kioupis2000,Nieto2006} is provided in Section \ref{Validation Runs} of Supporting Information.

	We investigate two different classes of viscosity, namely, saturated liquid viscosity $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$ and compressed liquid viscosities at a temperature of 293 K $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm comp})$. Saturated liquid viscosities are estimated by performing $NVT$ ensemble simulations at the saturation temperature $(T^{\rm sat})$ and saturated liquid density $(\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$. The simulation densities correspond to the REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$, which is admittedly not necessarily the same as the force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. This point is discussed in greater detail in Section \ref{Discussion/Limitations}. 
	
%	There are at least three reasons why we perform simulations at the REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ instead of the force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. First, this approach allows for a fair comparison of the force fields' ability to predict viscosity, without penalizing force fields which are less accurate at predicting $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ or rewarding force fields that mask their deficiencies in predicting viscosity by over- or under estimating $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. Second, since each of the studied force fields utilized $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ data in their optimization, deviations between the REFPROP and force field values are small, typically less than 1~\%. However, small differences in density have been reported to result in large differences in viscosity. For this reason, a small set of validation simulations are performed to determine the variability caused by utilizing the REFPROP densities. The force field saturated liquid densities were obtained from the literature.      
%	
%	The use of REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ caused some simulations to be in a meta-stable state. Specifically, this occurs when the force field vapor pressure is less than the REFPROP vapor pressure. Fortunately, this is uncommon as Potoff, TAMie, and AUA4 are quite reliable for estimating $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$ and TraPPE significantly over estimates $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$.
	
	Two different simulation protocols are implemented for estimating compressed liquid viscosities $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm comp})$. Specifically, we perform simulations with each force field either at the same $\rho$ or the same $P$. For the purpose of comparing the accuracy of force fields, these two methods are essentially equivalent. From a practical standpoint, estimating $\eta$ at a given $P$ requires performing preliminary $NPT$ ensemble simulations to determine the corresponding box size.
	
	% Since comparing force fields at the same density does not require a preliminary $NPT$ simulation to determine the box size, this approach has a small computational benefit. There is a small computational benefit t is computationally less expensive to perform simulations at the same densities, since this does not require a preliminary NPT there is no clear advantage for either approach.

%	Molecular dynamics simulations for this study are performed in the $NVT$ ensemble (constant number of molecules, $N$, constant volume, $V$, and constant temperature, $T$) using GROMACS version 2018 \cite{GROMACS_2018}. Each simulation uses the Velocity Verlet integrator with a 2 fs time-step, 1.4 nm cut-off for non-bonded interactions with tail corrections for energy and pressure \cite{GROMACS_note}, Nos{\'e}-Hoover thermostat with a time constant of 1 ps, and fixed bond-lengths constrained using LINCS with a LINCS-order of eight. Coulombic interactions are not computed as none of the force fields require partial charges for the compounds studied. The equilibration time is 0.1 ns for ethane and propane, 0.2 ns for \textit{n}-butane, and 0.5 ns for all other compounds. The production time is 1 ns for ethane, 2 ns for propane and \textit{n}-butane, and 4 ns for all other compounds. Replicate simulations are performed for \textit{n}-octane to validate that a single MD run of this length agrees with the average of several replicates, to within the combined uncertainty. A system size of 400 molecules is used for ethane, propane, and \textit{n}-butane, while all other compounds use 800 molecules. Example input files are provided as Supporting Information.

	\subsection{Data analysis}
	
	We implement the Green-Kubo ``time-decomposition'' analysis to extract viscosity from EMD simulations. We refer the interested reader to References \citenum{Maginn2018} and \citenum{Zhang2015} for details regarding this method. In brief, the Green-Kubo integral is computed with respect to time according to
%	\begin{equation} \label{eq:Green_Kubo}
%	\frac{V}{3 k_{\rm B} T N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{\alpha \ne \beta} \int_{0}^{\infty}dt\left\langle \tau_{\alpha\beta,n}(t) \tau_{\alpha\beta,n}(0)\right\rangle_{t_0}
%	\end{equation} 
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:Green_Kubo}
	\eta(t) = \frac{V}{3 k_{\rm B} T N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{\alpha \ne \beta} \int_{0}^{t}dt'\left\langle \tau_{\alpha\beta,n}(t') \tau_{\alpha\beta,n}(0)\right\rangle_{t_0}
	\end{equation} 
	where $t$ is time, $V$ is volume, $N_{\rm reps}$ is the number of independent replicate simulations, $\langle \cdots \rangle_{t_0}$ denotes an average over time origins $(t_0)$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are $x, y, $ or $z$ Cartesian coordinates, and $\tau_{\alpha\beta,n}$ is the $\alpha$-$\beta$ off-diagonal stress tensor element for the $n^{\rm th}$ replicate. 
	
	$\tau_{\alpha\beta,n}$ is recorded every 6 fs (3 time-steps) for accurate integration of Equation \ref{eq:Green_Kubo}. To improve precision, Equation \ref{eq:Green_Kubo} averages several (between 30 and 60) independent replicate simulations, twelve different time-origins, and all three unique off-diagonal stress tensor components (hence the factor of 3 in the denominator of Equation \ref{eq:Green_Kubo}).
	
	%	Since Equation \ref{eq:Green_Kubo} requires information as $t \rightarrow \infty$ and the ``running integral'' can become quite noisy at long times, it is important to fit the ``running integral'' to a function that can be extrapolated to the ``true'' infinite time limit $(\eta^{\infty})$. Per ``Best Practices'', we use a double-exponential function for this purpose
	
	The ``true'' viscosity, i.e., the infinite-time-limit viscosity, is obtained by evaluating Equation \ref{eq:Green_Kubo} as $t \rightarrow \infty$. However, the long-time tail of the Green-Kubo integral is often quite noisy and does not converge smoothly. For this purpose, we fit the ``running integral'' to a double-exponential function
	\begin{equation} \label{eq: Double exponential}
	\eta(t) = A \alpha \tau_1 \left(1-\exp{(-t/\tau_1)}\right) + A (1-\alpha) \tau_2 \left(1-\exp{(-t/\tau_2)}\right)
	\end{equation}
	where $A, \alpha, \tau_1, $ and $\tau_2$ are fitting parameters and $\eta^\infty = A \alpha \tau_1 + A (1-\alpha) \tau_2$ is the infinite-time-limit viscosity. 
	
%	Obtaining the ``true'' infinite time limit viscosity $(\eta^{\infty})$ requires evaluating Equation \ref{eq:Green_Kubo} as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Following ``Best Practices'', we fit a double-exponential function to the ``running integral''
%	\begin{equation} \label{eq: Double exponential}
%	\eta(t) = A \alpha \tau_1 \left(1-\exp{(-t/\tau_1)}\right) + A (1-\alpha) \tau_2 \left(1-\exp{(-t/\tau_2)}\right)
%	\end{equation}
%	where $A, \alpha, \tau_1, $ and $\tau_2$ are fitting parameters and $\eta^\infty = A \alpha \tau_1 + A (1-\alpha) \tau_2$.
	
	Since the Green-Kubo ``running integral'' suffers from extreme fluctuations at long times, Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} is fit by minimizing a weighted sum-squared error objective function. Weights are equal to the inverse of the standard deviation $(\sigma_{\eta})$ of the replicate simulations. The time dependence of $\sigma_{\eta}$ is modeled with $A t^{b}$, where $A$ and $b$ are fitting parameters.
	
	Despite weighting the data by $\sigma_{\eta}$, it can be challenging to obtain good fits of Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} when all the data are included. For this reason, data are excluded where $\sigma_{\eta} > 0.4 \times \eta^{\infty}$ \cite{Maginn2018,Zhang2015}. Occasionally, this heuristic results in a cut-off that is too short, in particular for systems with slow dynamics, which also leads to very poor fits. In such cases, it is necessary to modify the heuristic, e.g., exclude data where $\sigma_{\eta} > 0.8 \times \eta^{\infty}$. As erroneously large fluctuations also exist at very short times, only data for $t > 3$ ps are included in the fitting of Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} \cite{Maginn2018,Zhang2015}. 
	 
%	To account for the increasing fluctuations in the ``running integral'' with respect to time, Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} is fit by minimizing a weighted sum-squared error objective function. The weight model, $A t^{-b}$, is fit to the standard deviation $(\sigma_{\eta})$ of the replicate simulations. In addition, following a heuristic proposed by Zhang et al., data are excluded where $\sigma_{\eta} > 40$~\% $\eta^{\infty}$. Occasionally this heuristic resulted in a cut-off time that was too short, which lead to very poor fits. In such cases, it was necessary to manually increase the cut-off time. Large fluctuations also exist at very short times. Following ``Best Practices,'' only data for $t > 3$ ps are included in the fitting of Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential}. 
	
	The uncertainty in $\eta^{\infty}$ is obtained by bootstrap re-sampling. Specifically, the fitting process described previously is repeated hundreds of times using randomly selected subsets of replicate simulations. Furthermore, each bootstrap repetition uses a randomly selected long-time cut-off between 0.35 $\times \eta^{\infty}$ and 0.45 $\times \eta^{\infty}$ to account for uncertainty in the 0.4 $\times \eta^{\infty}$ heuristic. A 95~\% confidence interval is obtained from the distribution of bootstrap estimates for $\eta^\infty$. An example of this process is provided in Section \ref{SI:GK_analysis} of Supporting Information.
	
%	, and  are employed for a single MD run. The average of 30 to 60 independent replicate simulations $(N_{\rm reps})$ is fit to a double-exponential function by minimizing a weighted sum-squared error objective function.  
	
%	Following the ``Best Practices'' recommendation, we implement the Green-Kubo ``time-decomposition'' analysis to extract viscosity from EMD simulations. We refer the interested reader to References BLANK and BLANK for further details. In brief, the Green-Kubo integral is computed with respect to time for each independent MD simulation from the three off-diagonal components of the stress tensor
%	\begin{equation}
%	\frac{V}{3 k_{\rm B} T N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{n=1}^{N_{\rm reps}} \sum_{\alpha \ne \beta} \int_{0}^{\infty}dt\left\langle \tau_{\alpha\beta,n}(t) \tau_{\alpha\beta,n}(0)\right\rangle_{t_0}
%	\end{equation} 
%	where $V$ is the volume, $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\langle \cdots \rangle_{t_0}$ denotes an average over time origins, $\alpha$ and $\beta = x, y, $ or $z$ Cartesian coordinates, and $\tau_{\alpha\beta,n}$ is the $\alpha$-$\beta$ off-diagonal stress tensor element for the $n^{\rm th}$ replicate. 
	
%	$\tau_{\alpha\beta,n}$ is recorded every 6 fs (3 time-steps) to adequately integrate the initial rapid decay of the autocorrelation function. Twelve different time-origins $(t_0)$ are employed for a single MD run. The average of 30 to 60 independent replicate simulations $(N_{\rm reps})$ is fit to a double-exponential function by minimizing a weighted sum-squared error objective function. The weighting model, $A t^{-b}$, is fit to the standard deviation $(\sigma_{\eta})$ of the replicate simulations. Data are excluded at very short times, less than 3 ps, and at long times, when $\eta_{\sigma} > 40$~\% $\eta^{\infty}$. Uncertainties are obtained by bootstrap re-sampling replicate simulations and by varying the time cut-off between 30~\% and 50~\%. 
	
	%In addition, each bootstrap re-sampling utilizes a random cut-off time of 30~\% - 50~\%.

	\section{Results} \label{Results}
	
	Seven normal and seven branched alkanes of varying chain-length and degree of branching are simulated in this study. We only consider compounds with available REFPROP equations-of-state and viscosity correlations \cite{LEMMON-RP91}. Specifically, we simulate ethane \cite{Ethane2006,Vogel2015}, propane \cite{Propane2009,Vogel2016}, \textit{n}-butane \cite{Butane2006,Hermann2018}, \textit{n}-octane \cite{Beckmueller2017,Huber2004FPE}, \textit{n}-dodecane \cite{Lemmon2004,Huber2004}, \textit{n}-hexadecane \cite{Romeo2018,Vesovic2017}, \textit{n}-docosane \cite{Romeo2018,Huber2018}, 2-methylpropane \cite{Lemmon2006,Vogel2000}, 2-methylbutane \cite{Lemmon2006,Huber2018}, 2-methylpentane \cite{Lemmon2006,Huber2018}, 3-methylpentane \cite{Gao2017,Huber2018}, 2,2-dimethylpropane \cite{Lemmon2006,Huber2018}, 2,3-dimethylbutane \cite{Gao2017,Huber2018}, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane \cite{Blackham2017,Huber2018}. 
	
	Each compound was simulated using the TraPPE and Potoff S/L force fields. Potoff ``short'' parameters are employed for 2-methylpropane, 2-methylbutane, 2,2-dimethylpropane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane while Potoff ``long'' parameters are utilized for 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. Since we are not aware of any TAMie parameters for C sites, 2,2-dimethylpropane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane were not simulated using the TAMie force field. Only ethane and 2,2-dimethylpropane were simulated with AUA4. See Section \ref{Systems simulated} of Supporting Information for a comprehensive list of all systems studied.
	
	Sections \ref{sec:eta_sat} and \ref{sec:T293highP} present results for saturated liquid viscosities $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat})$ and compressed liquid viscosities $(\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm comp})$, respectively. In both sections, the \textit{n}-alkane results are followed by the branched alkane results. Simulation results are compared with the REFPROP viscosity correlations and experimental data from the ThermoData Engine (TDE) database \cite{TDE}. Tabulated simulation values are provided in Section \ref{SI:Tabulated} of Supporting Information.

As the remainder of this section demonstrates, the over estimation of ethane $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ is actually an anomaly for normal and branched alkanes. It is not uncommon for the smallest compounds in a homologous series, i.e., methane and ethane, to follow a different trend than the larger compounds. However, the relative magnitudes of the different force fields is consistent with other compounds, namely, TraPPE (and TraPPE-2) viscosities are less than those of TAMie which are less than the Potoff viscosities. This is expected since TraPPE utilizes a LJ 12-6, TAMie a Mie 14-6, and Potoff a Mie 16-6 potential. By comparing the TraPPE and TraPPE-2 results, it appears that the anisotropic CH$_3$-CH$_3$ bond significantly reduces the viscosity of ethane.

This is expected considering the respective values of $\lambda$ (the repulsive exponent), i.e., $\lambda = 12$ for TraPPE, TraPPE-2, and AUA4, $\lambda = 14$ for TAMie, and $\lambda = 16$ for Potoff. Note that the TraPPE results are similar to the TraPPE-2 and AUA4 results. Therefore, although the anisotropic CH$_3$-CH$_3$ bond provides considerable improvement in simultaneously reproducing vapor-liquid coexistence densities and pressure, it does not appear to significantly improve the viscosity estimates for ethane.

Similar to what has been demonstrated in previous studies, the TraPPE force field significantly under estimates $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ (between 30 and 80~\%) with the deviation increasing with decreasing temperature \cite{Gordon2006,Nieto2006}. By contrast, the Potoff and TAMie force fields agree with the REFPROP values for these compounds to within 10~\%. Although TAMie deviations for propane increase to approximately 50~\% at the triple point temperature, Potoff deviations are nearly constant over the entire temperature range studied for each compound.

The TraPPE percent deviations for these compounds are similar to those observed in Figure \ref{fig:Saturation_C3_C4_C8} for smaller \textit{n}-alkanes. However, TAMie and Potoff percent deviations demonstrate a stronger temperature dependence for these larger \textit{n}-alkanes, i.e., the percent deviations increase with decreasing temperature. Although the cause of this trend is unclear, Section \ref{Discussion/Limitations} suggests that the cut-off distance impacts these larger compounds more than smaller compounds, especially at lower $T^{\rm sat}$.
	
	%The cause of this trend is unclear but, since it is only observed for larger compounds, it is likely attributed to the torsional potential or the transferability of the CH$_2$ Mie $\lambda$-6 parameters.

Figures \ref{fig:Saturation_short_branched} and \ref{fig:Saturation_long_branched} present results for the compounds classified by Potoff as ``short'' and ``long'', respectively \cite{Mie}. Specifically, Figure \ref{fig:Saturation_short_branched} depicts 2-methylpropane, 2,2-dimethylpropane, 2-methylbutane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane, while Figure \ref{fig:Saturation_long_branched} contains 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. As explained previously, each compound is simulated using the TraPPE and Potoff force fields, 2,2-dimethylpropane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane are not simulated using  TAMie, and only 2,2-dimethylpropane is simulated with AUA4.
	
	%From Figure \ref{fig:Saturation_IC4_NEOC5} to \ref{fig:Saturation_IC6_23DMB_3MP}, we see that the Potoff S/L force field is not as accurate for the simulated branched alkanes as for the normal alkanes. However, it still provides considerable improvement compared to the LJ 12-6 based models, i.e., TraPPE and AUA4. Surprisingly, the TAMie force field performs much worse for these branched alkanes.

	From Figures \ref{fig:Saturation_short_branched} and \ref{fig:Saturation_long_branched}, we see that the Potoff S/L and TAMie force fields are not as accurate for these branched alkanes as for the normal alkanes. In particular, Potoff and TAMie deviations demonstrate the same temperature dependence observed for other force fields, where the percent deviations are largest at lower temperatures. However, Potoff still provides considerable improvement compared to the LJ 12-6 based models, i.e., TraPPE and AUA4. Note that the Potoff ``short'' and ``long'' parameters in Figures \ref{fig:Saturation_short_branched} and \ref{fig:Saturation_long_branched}, respectively, provide similar accuracy. 
	
	%The one apparent exception is 3-methylpentane, where the Potoff deviations are less than 10~\% over the entire temperature range. However, considering the availabi 
	
	The deviations for each force field are largest for 2-methylpropane and 2,2-dimethylpropane, the two smallest and most spherical branched alkanes. Since these compounds are primarily composed of CH$_3$ UA sites, this poor performance is likely due to the assumption that the CH$_3$ non-bonded parameters are transferable from \textit{n}-alkanes to branched alkanes. Improvement might be possible if the CH$_3$ parameters were different depending on the neighboring UA site type. However, it is also important to note that the 2,2-dimethylpropane REFPROP viscosity correlation is not considered to be of ``reference quality.'' \cite{LEMMON-RP91}
	
	\subsection{Compressed liquid} \label{sec:T293highP}
	
	Section \ref{sec:eta_sat} demonstrates that Mie $\lambda$-6 based force fields (Potoff and TAMie) are considerably more reliable for predicting saturated liquid viscosities than LJ 12-6 based force fields (TraPPE and AUA4). However, as the Mie $\lambda$-6 potential is too repulsive at short distances for $\lambda > 12$, the Potoff (Mie 16-6) and TAMie (Mie 14-6) force fields tend to over estimate pressure at high densities \cite{Postdoc_2}. Since $\eta$ also increases with larger values of $\lambda$, our \textit{ansatz} is that Potoff and TAMie over estimate $\eta$ at high densities/pressures. 
	
	Surprisingly, Gordon shows that a (slightly modified) Mie 14-6 (for CH$_3$) and Mie 20-6 (for CH$_2$) potential can accurately predict the $\eta$-$P$ dependence for \textit{n}-hexadecane up to 400 MPa \cite{Gordon2006}. Since the Gordon force field was parameterized with $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ data, the purpose of this section is to determine if the Potoff and TAMie force fields, which did not include viscosity data in their parameterization, are also reliable for estimating the $\eta$-$P$ dependence. To provide additional insight into the consequences of using a Mie $\lambda$-6 potential with $\lambda > 12$, we present results for the $\eta$-$\rho$ dependence as well (which was not reported by Gordon). 
	
%	Note that Reference \citenum{Gordon2006} did not report the $\eta$-$\rho$ dependence, utilizes a slightly modified Mie formulation, and included saturated liquid viscosity data in the non-bonded parameterization.

	Figures \ref{fig:T293highP_C3}, \ref{fig:T293highP_C4}, and \ref{fig:T293highP_C8} demonstrate that the TraPPE force field has a constant negative bias even with increasing density/pressure. The TAMie force field has the most accurate $\eta$-$\rho$ dependence, i.e., the error does not increase significantly with respect to density. By contrast, the Potoff potential demonstrates considerable over estimation of $\eta$ at high densities, which is likely attributed to the overly repulsive Mie 16-6 potential at close distances. Remarkably, the Potoff force field is the most accurate at predicting the $\eta$-$P$ dependence from saturation to elevated pressures (approaching 1000 MPa). This can be explained as a cancellation of errors since the Potoff force field significantly over predicts both $\eta$ and $P$ at high densities. Note that the increase in Potoff deviations for the two highest pressures in Figure \ref{fig:T293highP_C3} can potentially be explained by the large uncertainty in the REFPROP correlation and dubious extrapolation at these extreme pressures. Therefore, although Potoff should not be used to estimate the $\eta$-$\rho$ dependence, we conclude that it is the most reliable force field for estimating the $\eta$-$P$ dependence.

   The trends observed in Figures \ref{fig:T293highP_IC4} to \ref{fig:T293highP_IC8} for branched alkanes are consistent with the compressed liquid trends for \textit{n}-alkanes. Specifically, TraPPE under predicts $\eta$ with respect to both $\rho$ and $P$. Potoff over predicts $\eta$ with respect to $\rho$ but provides a reasonable estimate of the $\eta$-$P$ trend. However, as observed in Section \ref{sec:eta_sat} for $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$, Potoff and TAMie are less accurate for branched alkanes than for \textit{n}-alkanes. In particular, the Potoff $\eta$-$P$ trends are systematically lower than the REFPROP correlations for 2-methylbutane and 3-methylpentane. However, note that the Potoff $\eta$-$P$ trends are quite reliable for 2-methylpropane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. These results cannot be attributed to the ``short'' or ``long'' parameter distinction, since 2-methylbutane and 2-methylpropane both use ``short'' parameters while 3-methylpentane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane both use ``long'' parameters.

	\section{Discussion/Limitations} \label{Discussion/Limitations}
	
	\subsection{Liquid structure} \label{sec:RDF}
	
	While the Potoff force field significantly over predicts $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm comp}$ at high densities and $T= 293$ K, it does not over predict $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ for the highest saturated liquid densities (those near the triple point temperature) (cf. Figures \ref{fig:Saturation_C3_C4_C8} and \ref{fig:T293highP_C3} for propane). To better understand this seemingly inconsistent result, Figure \ref{fig:RDF_comparison_CH3} compares the radial distribution functions (RDF) for the Potoff, TAMie, and TraPPE force fields at three different state points, namely, near the triple point $(T=86$ K and $\rho = 732.63$ kg/m$^3)$ and two densities along the $T = 293$ K isotherm ($\rho = 732.63$ kg/m$^3$ and $\rho = 806.23$ kg/m$^3)$. In order to provide a fair comparison between force fields, the RDF is plotted with respect to a reduced distance, namely, $r/r_{\rm min}$.

	The top panel of Figure \ref{fig:RDF_comparison_CH3} demonstrates that the RDF shifts to the left (closer interactions) when increasing the temperature from 86 K to 293 K at $\rho = 732.63$ kg/m$^3$. Although the magnitude of this shift is similar for all three force fields, the Potoff viscosities appear to be impacted the most due to the steepness of the Mie 16-6 potential. By contrast, the bottom panel demonstrates that increasing the density at constant temperature (293 K) does not shift the RDF, although it does increase the frequency of close-range interactions. Therefore, the overly repulsive Mie 16-6 potential is only problematic at high densities if there is sufficient thermal energy for the system to sample extremely close-range interactions. This explains why the Potoff force field is reliable near the triple point but significantly over estimates $\eta$ for high density systems at 293 K.

	%Therefore, It is clear from Figure \ref{fig:RDF_comparison_CH3} that the higher pressure simulations sample from much closer interactions than the triple point and, therefore, these close interactions cause the over estimation of compressed liquid viscosities but not saturated high density liquid viscosities.

	\subsection{Finite-size effects} \label{Finite-size effects}

	Although finite-size effects are often assumed to be negligible for viscosity estimates with equilibrium molecular dynamics, we validate this assumption by plotting $\eta$ with respect to $N^{-1/3}$ \cite{Maginn2018}. Figure \ref{fig:finite_size_effects} compares simulation results for 100, 200, 400, and 800 molecule systems. While Figure \ref{fig:finite_size_effects} only presents results for propane, we also observe similar results for a larger compound, specifically, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.
	
	%Previous studies have demonstrated that finite-size effects are often negligible for viscosity estimates with equilibrium molecular dynamics.
	
	%However, since this analysis is typically not reported in the literature, the ``Best Practices'' guide recommends validating that finite-size effects are indeed negligible. For this reason,
	
	%The dashed lines are averages of the four system sizes while the solid line is a linear fit with respect to $N^{-1/3}$.

		\label{fig:finite_size_effects}
	\end{figure} 
	
	Notice that the averages and uncertainties in Figure \ref{fig:finite_size_effects} are typically quite similar for the different values of $N$, although some clear exceptions exist, e.g., $N = 800$ and $N=400$ for $T = 166$ K. Although the uncertainties do not overlap in all cases, there does not appear to be a consistent trend for $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ with respect to $N^{-1/3}$. Therefore, we do not consider the lack of overlap between error bars of certain systems to be evidence of finite-size effects. Rather, this demonstrates the difficulty in obtaining completely consistent values with the EMD Green-Kubo methodology, even when following ``Best Practices.'' Furthermore, note that extrapolating to $N^{-1/3} \rightarrow 0$, i.e., $N \rightarrow \infty$, can result in unrealistic estimates of $\eta$. For these reasons, we do not recommend the linear fit and extrapolation approach to correct for finite-size effects.

	%%% This method did not appear to be useful in the end
	
%	In addition to this visual inspection, we also perform a ``hypothesis test'' to determine if the results from different system sizes are statistically indistinguishable. We utilize the following ``random permutation test'' \cite{BLANK}:
%	
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Compute the ``observed'' sum-of-squares between the four different system sizes $(SS_{\rm obs})$
%		\item Randomly divide all of the replicate simulations (regardless of system size) into four groups, ``A'', ``B'', ``C'', and ``D'' \label{item:shuffling}
%		\item Average the replicate Green-Kubo integrals of each group \label{item:averaging}
%		\item Fit Equation \ref{eq: Double exponential} to the averages from Step \ref{item:averaging} \label{item:fitting}
%		\item Calculate the ``permutated'' sum-of-squares between the four different groups $(SS_{\rm perm}$ \label{item:SS_ABCD}
%		\item Repeat Steps \ref{item:shuffling} to \ref{item:SS_ABCD} hundreds of times $(N_{\rm perm})$
%		\item Count the number of permutations where $SS_{\rm perm} > SS_{\rm obs}$ $(N_{\rm rej})$ \label{item:counting}
%		\item Assign a $p$-value equal to the ratio of $N_{\rm rej}$ divided by $N_{\rm perm}$
%		\item If $p > 0.05$, we fail to reject the Null-hypothesis that all four system sizes are statistically equivalent, i.e., finite-size effects are likely negligible
%	\end{enumerate}
%
%	This approach is employed in place of the standard Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test because it is not possible to compute a reliable $F$-statistic. Computing the $F$-statistic requires the sum-of-squares between replicates, which is not well-defined because an individual replicate simulation does not provide a meaningful estimate of $\eta$. Therefore, we can only compute the sum-of-squares between averages and not the sum-of-squares between replicates. However, since the sum-of-squares between replicates is a constant value regardless of the grouping in Step \ref{item:shuffling}, comparing the sum-of-squares is equivalent to comparing the $F$-statistic.

	\subsection{Cut-off distance} \label{Cut-off distance}
	
	The choice of cut-off distance is a subtle but important decision. In this study, we implement a 1.4 nm cut-off for TraPPE, TraPPE-2, TAMie, and AUA4 but a 1.0 nm cut-off for Potoff, as these are the cut-off lengths implemented by the respective authors. To determine the impact of the cut-off on viscosity estimates, we perform simulations with the Potoff force field using three different cut-off distances. Specifically, Figure \ref{fig:cutoff_distance} presents the Potoff $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ values for \textit{n}-butane, \textit{n}-octane, and \textit{n}-dodecane using cut-offs of 1.0 nm, 1.4 nm, and 1.8 nm.

%	Figure \ref{fig:cutoff_distance} demonstrates that for smaller compounds the impact of cut-off is negligible. For larger compounds, such as \textit{n}-dodecane, a 1.0 nm cut-off leads to significant error. In fact, \textit{n}-hexadecane and \textit{n}-docosane were unstable with a 1.0 nm cut-off and a 2 fs time-step. Reducing the time step to 1 fs was capable of stabilizing the 1.0 nm cut-off, but would require twice the computational time. Note that even the 1.4 nm cut-off results are not identical to those with a 1.8 nm cut-off. However, since the computationally expensive operation of computing pair interactions is proportional to the square of the cut-off, the 1.8 nm cut-off increases the simulation wall-time by nearly a factor of two compared to the 1.4 nm cut-off. For these reasons, the Potoff results for \textit{n}-dodecane, \textit{n}-hexadecane, and \textit{n}-docosane presented previously in Figure \ref{fig:Saturation_C12_C16_C22} were actually obtained using a 1.4 nm cut-off.
%
%    Recall in Figure \ref{fig:Saturation_C12_C16_C22} that the longer \textit{n}-alkanes demonstrate a temperature dependent deviation for the Potoff force field, which was not observed for smaller compounds. Based on the results in Figure \ref{fig:cutoff_distance}, we propose that this deviation is not a limitation in the force field, but rather is an artifact of the cut-off length.

	The instability of a 1.0 nm cut-off (with 2 fs time-steps) and the discrepancy in $\eta$ values obtained with different cut-offs demonstrate the importance of verifying that the cut-off distance is long enough to not impact the system dynamics. Furthermore, this demonstrates a scenario where alternative tail modifications may be preferable, e.g., force-shift or switch-force \cite{GROMACS_2018}. Unfortunately, these tail modifications significantly impact thermophysical properties, suggesting that the non-bonded parameters must be re-optimized with the tail modification \cite{Thol_LJTS,Thol2016_LJ}. Therefore, performing simulations with a force-shift or switch-force potential for Potoff, TraPPE, TAMie, and AUA4 would likely result in inaccurate viscosities. Re-parameterizing the non-bonded interactions for a force-shift or switch-force potential is beyond the scope of this study.
	
	\subsection{REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ vs. force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$}
	
	The use of REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ instead of the force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ can lead to meta-stable simulations and spurious results. This occurs when the force field $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$ is less than the REFPROP $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$. Fortunately, this is uncommon since Potoff, TAMie, AUA4, and TraPPE-2 are quite reliable for estimating $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$ and TraPPE significantly over estimates $P_{\rm vap}^{\rm sat}$. Furthermore, it is important that the force field melting point is below the simulation $T^{\rm sat}$. This does not appear to be an issue, however, since the RDFs for each force field are liquid-like even for the propane simulations near the triple point temperature (cf. top panel of Figure \ref{fig:RDF_comparison_CH3}).
	
%	even the lowest temperature simulations of propane did not appear to be below the melting point for each force field, i.e., the RDFs were liquid-like (cf. top panel of Figure \ref{fig:RDF_comparison_CH3}). 
	
	There are at least four reasons why we perform simulations at the REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ instead of the force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. First, this approach allows for a fair comparison of the force fields' ability to predict viscosity, without penalizing force fields which are less accurate at predicting $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ or rewarding force fields that mask their deficiencies in predicting viscosity by over- or under estimating $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$.
	Second, this facilitates comparing force fields over the entire range of saturation temperatures, whereas this is extremely challenging using standard simulation methods for determining vapor-liquid saturation densities, such as Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) or Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) histogram reweighting (HR). Third, it is straightforward, at least qualitatively, to account for a systematic deviation between the force field and REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$, e.g., a positive bias in $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ will increase $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. Fourth, since each of the studied force fields were optimized with $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ data, deviations between the REFPROP and force field densities are small, typically less than 1~\% (see Table 1 of Reference \citenum{Potoff_branched}). 
	
	However, due to the exponential dependence of $\eta$ on $\rho$, small differences in $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ can result in relatively large deviations in $\eta_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. For this reason, we perform a small set of validation simulations to determine the variability caused by utilizing the force field or REFPROP values for $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$. Specifically, we simulate \textit{n}-butane with Potoff, TraPPE, and TAMie and 3-methylpentane with Potoff and TraPPE using the $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ literature values reported for the corresponding force field \cite{Martin1999,Mie,Potoff_branched,TAMie}, where Reference \citenum{Martin1999} utilizes GEMC and References \citenum{TAMie,Mie,Potoff_branched} use GCMC-HR.      
	
	The results with the ``true'' force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ for \textit{n}-butane and 3-methylpentane are found in Figures \ref{fig:Saturation_C3_C4_C8} and \ref{fig:Saturation_long_branched}, respectively, as filled symbols. Note that the Potoff, TAMie, and TraPPE \textit{n}-butane and TraPPE 3-methylpentane filled points are consistent with the respective empty points. This is due to the good agreement between the force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ and the REFPROP $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ (less than 0.3~\%). By contrast, the Potoff 3-methylpentane filled point is approximately 3~\% lower than the respective empty points. This is because the Potoff force field under estimates $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ by around 1.15~\% \cite{Potoff_branched}. In comparison, the Potoff S/L deviations in $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ are between -0.12~\% and -0.60~\% for all other branched compounds studied. TraPPE deviations in $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ are less than $\pm$ 0.6~\% for all compounds except for 2,2-dimethylpropane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, which have -1.55~\% and 2.81~\% deviations, respectively. Therefore, utilizing the actual force field $\rho_{\rm liq}^{\rm sat}$ values would not alter the qualitative trends observed in Figures \ref{fig:Saturation_Ethane} to \ref{fig:Saturation_long_branched} and should only modify the quantitative values by a few percent in most cases and not more than 10~\% in the most extreme cases.

	\section{Conclusions} \label{Conclusions}
	
	This study demonstrates the improvement that has taken place over the past two decades for predicting viscosity with molecular simulation. First, following ``Best Practices'' for EMD lead to more reproducible results. Second, the state-of-the-art Mie $\lambda$-6 force fields are significantly more accurate than the traditional Lennard-Jones 12-6 force fields for viscosity, as well as for vapor-liquid coexistence properties. More specifically, the Potoff and TAMie force fields typically predict saturated liquid viscosities for \textit{n}-alkanes to within 10~\% of the REFPROP values. By contrast, the TraPPE and AUA4 models under predict saturated liquid viscosities by 20~\% to 50~\%, where the deviations are largest at lower temperatures. While Potoff and TAMie are also more reliable for branched alkanes, deviations are larger and demonstrate a similar temperature dependence. 
	
	The key limitation of the Potoff force field is that the choice of $\lambda = 16$ is too repulsive at close distances, which causes the viscosity to be over estimated at high densities. Due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors, the Potoff potential does provide a reliable $\eta$-$P$ trend. Since TAMie uses $\lambda =14$, the $\eta$-$\rho$ trend is slightly more reliable than that of Potoff. It is important to emphasize that transport properties were not included in the training set for parameterizing the Potoff and TAMie force fields. Therefore, the results from this study demonstrate that the improved prediction of static vapor-liquid coexistence properties obtained with Mie $\lambda$-6 potentials also results in improved prediction of a dynamic property, liquid viscosity.
